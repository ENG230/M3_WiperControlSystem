Rainwater, dust and exhaust gas chemicals from vehicles that stick to the surface of an automobile windshield are probably not an issue as long as the driver has an unobstructed view of the road. However, if the sticking substances are left unchecked, they will become a threat for travel safety.

A windshield wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms. The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear view for the driver and passenger. A specially-shaped rubber wiping lip ensures an optimal wiping result 

wipers are vital for driver visibility. The vehicle is considered unsafe if the wipers don't work. The front wiper motor and the wiper transmission mechanism (linkage) are installed below the windshield, under the cowl panel cover.
