## Introduction:

The main purpose of the wiper Control system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.

The front windshield wiper system is one of the safety systems in a vehicle, which is categorized as a passive safety system because it only works when needed. The front windshield wipersfunction to ensure that the driver’s view remainsunobstructed when rain and or other natural disturbances occur.
Today’s car wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching. So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on
detecting rain and stops when the rain stops. Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system not need manual intervention


## Features:

A windshield wiper control system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms. The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear view for the driver and passenger. A specially-shaped rubber wiping lip ensures an optimal wiping result.

Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor. The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.
