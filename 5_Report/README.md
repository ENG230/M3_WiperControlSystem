## Introduction:

The main purpose of the wiper Control system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
Rainwater, dust and exhaust gas chemicals from vehicles that stick to the surface of an automobile windshield are probably not an issue as long as the driver has an unobstructed view of the road. However, if the sticking substances are left unchecked, they will become a threat for travel safety.

A windshield wiper control system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms. The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear view for the driver and passenger. A specially-shaped rubber wiping lip ensures an optimal wiping result

Wipers are vital for driver visibility. The vehicle is considered unsafe if the wipers don't work. The front wiper motor and the wiper transmission mechanism (linkage) are installed below the windshield, under the cowl panel cover.

Here we implemented Wiper Control System using STM32F4Discovery Board.

Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor. The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.
