## Introduction:
A windshield wiper control system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms. The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear view for the driver and passenger. A specially-shaped rubber wiping lip ensures an optimal wiping result.

Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor. The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.

## Features:
A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor(30) detecting rain conditions to produce an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions.
