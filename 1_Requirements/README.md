# Introduction:

The main purpose of the wiper Control system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.

The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.

The front windshield wiper system is one of the safety systems in a vehicle, which is categorized as a passive safety system because it only works when needed. The front windshield wipersfunction to ensure that the driver’s view remainsunobstructed when rain and or other natural disturbances occur.

# Software Requiremets:

# Components:
STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
## Description
# STM32F407VG
The STM32F407 Kit takes advantage of the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers capabilities to make it simple for users to create audio-based applications. It comes with an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, an ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector.Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features have been added to the STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core, which runs at up to 168 MHz.
# 4W'S & 1H:
# What is Wiper control system
 Wiper control system is a system used to remove rain and debris from a windscreen.

# Why
 It is used To clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
# When
The windshield wipers eliminate downpour and snow from the windshield, while the headlights further develop perceivability around evening time.

# Who
Mark Anderson invented on 1902.
# How
You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system  by altering the frequency according to the rainfall.
